# 11 Optimizing Performance

This chapter covers the following topics

* measuring a web application performance
* identifying hot code paths using flamegraphs
* measuring a function performance
* optimizing a function

## Introduction

Node.js is a runtime built for evented I/O where multiple execution
flows, e.g. HTTP requests, are progressed concurrently but not in parallel.
Only one of them is being executed at any given time.
Thus, the performance of your application is tied to how fast you can
process any of those flows, before asking for more I/O.
This chapter is about making your Node.js code as fast as possible to
get your application to handle more I/O.
